<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The purpose of the CEBAF Nomenclature Document (CND) is to provide a standard system of unique names to represent pieces of accelerator and experimental equipment.  Naming is mostly limited to objects found along the beam line.   Nomenclature identification is used on drawings, schematics, computer software, and other sources of information.   IOCs and equipment racks have their own independent naming scheme.  Items in the LERF and Halls may be included.</p>
<h3>Name Construction</h3>
<p>
    All names have a maximum of nine characters, a minimum of five characters, and all letters are upper case.  Names are constructed from a set of up to five codes, which reveal the object's system, type, sector, locator, and element number.  Only the first three codes are required.  The
    letters S V V X X Y Y Z Z are used to symbolize the five codes in a nine-character name. The
    meaning of these letters is as follows:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>S</th>
            <td>Technical System</td>
            <td>A single letter is used to symbolize a major system
                such as a C for cryogenics or M for magnets.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>VV</th>
            <td>Component Type</td>
            <td>Two letters are used to symbolize component types
                such as CV for check valve (Cryogenics system).  All component types are
                dependent on a technical system.  In other words the component type may have a different meaning depending on the system.  For example CV means Yao Cavity if paired with the Instrumentation system or it means 12GeV Dipole when paired with the Magnet system. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>XX</th>
            <td>Sector or Subsystem</td>
            <td>Two characters, which can be a number or letter
                in either position, are used to symbolize a location, a subsystem, or a
                large piece of equipment.  For example, 1L is used for the North Linac, 29
                is used for the vacuum system in the Cryogenic Test Facility, and 3E is used
                for the third extractor. Sectors and subsystems are not tied to a particular
                technical system.  Not all technical systems use the XX positions.  In which
                case, the positions are left blank</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>YY</th>
            <td>Locator</td>
            <td>Two numbers are used to symbolize a location within a
                sector (XX), such as the sequential numbering of quadrupoles within a
                sector.  All non-girdered components are numbered per the upstream quad.
                Exceptions:  Dipoles are numbered sequentially within a sector.
                Cryomodules match the 'zone' number (first module is #2
                and the last is #26).  This number controls the upstream
                components.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>ZZ</th>
            <td>Element Number</td>
            <td>Optionally one or two trailing letters or numbers are used to provide more specificity when naming a component.  An example of the usage of element numbers
                is using numbers 1 through 8 to indicate the cavities in a cryomodule. Using
                H to indicate a horizontal configuration for a beam position monitor is
                another example.</td>

    Example:  IDA2C04

<p>
    This is an Insertable Beam Stop in Line B of the BSY between quad girders
    04 & 05.  This is broken down as follows:

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
    A Nomenclature Document was first published as part of CEBAF
    Technical note 91-083 in October 1991.  Updated revisions were published
    and distributed in December 1992 and 1993.  The document was converted to a
    menu-driven computer database in 1994, which provided a search capability.
    The software was upgraded in April 1995 to include the capabilities to
    print or browse through the entire document. In 1996, the nomenclature was
    added to the JLAB web home page.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhere along the line it seems the database was abandoned and an Excel file was used instead.   In 2015 the nomenclature was moved to its current home on the accelerator
    Intranet web server and database where a form-based interface allows easy up-keep for maintainers.

<h3>Other Naming Schemes and Aliases</h3>
<p>The EPICS control system PV name associated with a component often differs from the CEBAF Nomenclature.
    The CEBAF Element Database (CED) may provide another alternate name for a component.
    For example the cryomodule with canonical CND name RCA1L04 is known as 1L04 in the CED and as R14 in EPICS.
    It is also possible to reference this component as
    CCA1L04 because like many components it is part of multiple systems (both RF and Cryo).</p>
